# RevolutionaryStuff

This is a utility library created by Jason Thomas.  

I've used these types of libraries since .NET 1.0 beta 1.0, but finally got off my ass and decided to publish to a GIT repository and make it available via a nuget package.  

**Use at your own risk!  Don't expect any support!  Don't expect me to accept any syncs!**

That said... a couple of projects I've been part of for at least 2 different companies use these libraries, so I'm going to do my best to keep things stable. And in 2019, well perhaps mid-2019, I may be open to pull requests.
