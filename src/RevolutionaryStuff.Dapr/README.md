## What is Revolutionary Stuff and what are these libraries?
[Revolutionary Stuff](https://revolutionarystuff.com/) is a company [I](https://www.jasonthomas.com/) created a while back to work on creative ideas.

These libraries are a collection of utilities and tools I've created since .NET 1 Beta 2 (don't worry, there have been a few updates since then).

I use these is virtually all of the .NET projects I create to speed my development.
